# Churn Modeling in a Bank using ANN

This project is aimed at predicting customer churn for a bank using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or customers, and being able to predict which customers are likely to leave is crucial for retention strategies.

## Key Features of the Project:
- **Dataset**: The project uses a publicly available dataset of bank customers, including customer demographics and account information.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, encoding, scaling, and splitting into training and test sets.
- **Model Architecture**: ANN with multiple layers, using ReLU and Sigmoid activations.
- **Training**: Backpropagation with binary cross-entropy and Adam optimizer.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `app.py` script to train the model.
4. Evaluate the model and visualize the results.
